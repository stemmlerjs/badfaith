Don't 

Take it on alone

I've been down that road

You need someone to call your own

<br/>

And if you want

You can leave your home

You can feel real low

To do it alone

To Be it alone

<br/>

To be a ghost in real life

Waste your precious life

And step in, step inside and 

Realize

That you can feel even lower

Feel even lower

When you know, you know

<br/>

But I'm here - alive 

We can sit and watch the - watch the stars go by

And my body's true

And it knows that I miss you, well

<br/>

You're my love

You can stay real long

'Cause I don't want to be alone

When my body's done

When the angels have been withdrawn

'Cause I'm flesh and bone

And I can't take 'em where I'm going
