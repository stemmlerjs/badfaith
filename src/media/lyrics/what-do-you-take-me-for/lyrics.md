track: 7
---

I've known a lot of girls before

I dont want it anymore

Since you came into my life 

I've taken a wild ride

<br/>

What do you take me for?

I expect nothing more

What do you take me for?

<br/>

What do you mean?

Oh, what do you mean when you say you love me?

<br/>

What do you take me for?

Sleeping by the door

What do you take me for?

I don't believe anymore

<br/>

What do you mean?

Oh, what do you mean when you say you love me?
