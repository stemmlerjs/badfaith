Baby, you know I love you so

You give me meaning that I've never known

I got a place I want to go

I don't wanna go in alone

<br/>

Stand in the light

To simply Be is to hurt tonight

To Be is to hurt

<br/>

When things get hard don't you say you're giving up / not tonight 

<br/>

Baby, you don't

<span id="reason-to-live">No reason to live is no reason to die tonight</span>

Baby, your heart 

<br/>

Stand in the light

And that bottle of hate you've got

I won't stop 'till you 

Stand in the light

<br/>

So let me be someone

You know and I know, you're undone

<br/>

Baby, you don't

No reason to live is no reason to die tonight

Baby, your heart 

<br/>

Stand in the light
