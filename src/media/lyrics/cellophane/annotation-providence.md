Traditional theism holds that God is the creator of heaven and earth, and that all that occurs in the universe takes place under Divine _Providence_ â€” that is, under God's sovereign guidance and control. According to believers, God governs creation as a loving father, working all things for good.

German philosopher and Existentialist, Friedrich Nietzsche, famously said "God is Dead" to express his idea that the Enlightenment (an intellectual and philosophical movement that dominated the world of ideas in Europe during the 17th and 18th centuries) had eliminated the possibility of the existence of God.

Absurdism asserts there is no _providence_. No cosmic justice or guardian angels. There is only the inherent meaninglessness of existence.
