<span id="myth">I've got cellophane on my mind</span>

All you itty-bitty people are gonna die

On my balcony, it's all messed up

<span id="providence">God's playing a game show and he don't give a fuck</span>

<br/>

When will it get ya, oh when's the time?

Want to take a spin on the wheel of time? 

A mother cries out to her son

Well, that's no fun, don't be a stick in the mud

<br/>

<span id="childhood">Starts out real great with making shapes</span>

<span id="reality">Then you might chewed out straight / or catch a break</span>

Some have it good, some have it hard

<span id="works">And some make works, some make it by</span>

<br/>

I've got cellophane on my mind

Every itty-bitty person has to try

To find a way to keep your head up

Gonna keep on keeping in a meaningless world

<br/>

I love the way the moon brushes your eyes

Rodney shrieks to God that he don't want to die

I can't wait to be with you forever

<span id="death">And people never leave in the order that they enter</span>

<br/>

Starts out real great with making shapes

Then you might chewed out straight / or catch a break

Some have it good, some have it hard

And some make works, some make it by

<br/>

Baby girl

You know I love you so

But as time goes and flows

Everything must come to an end

And it's time for us

<span id="destiny">And now it's time for you and me</span>

Like dust

As if nothing ever was

Remember when you looked into my eyes?
