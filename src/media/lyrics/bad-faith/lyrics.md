You and I / you and me 

Cant deny

The <span id="bad-faith">bad faith</span> in your life 

Behind your eyes

In society 

Feeling like

You wanna run away

<span id="pulling-punches">Pulling punches</span> everyday

Oh, what can I say

<span id="insane">You're not insane</span>

Okay

It's alright 

<br/>

Everything (you know) is gonna be alright

Someday you and me are gonna die

And you feel like it just dont make sense 

Someday you and me are gonna die

<br/>

Scrapbook, baby just write it away

<span id="distractions">Distractions</span>, baby focus away

Gimme something that'll take it away

Like love or Christianity
