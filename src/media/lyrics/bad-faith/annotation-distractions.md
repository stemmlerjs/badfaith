- Anguish = the awareness of our own freedom
- Forlornness = the awareness of God's nonexistence
- Despair = the awareness that we cannot control the actions of others
- Shame = the awareness of being objects of experience by others

Four inescapable parts of our existence. It's possible to shove these things out of our consciousness in the short-term.

The idea for the long-term then, is to find a worthwhile distraction. Love and religion are common two common ones.
