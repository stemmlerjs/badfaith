To existentialists, _absurdity_ is a technical term that represents the search for answers in an answerless world.

There is no absolute meaning, order, cosmic justic, fairness, or rules to live by.

_Bad faith_, then, is a refusal to accept the absurd. 

Existentialists believe that any meaning your life has is, ultimately given by _you_. This means we are forced to design our own moral code to live by. We are "condemned to be free".


Your parents, church, and government are people just like you - people who had to figure out how to live.

To live in _bad faith_ is to bury your head in the sand, to live un-authentically, and by some meaning that someone else created in a world of meaninglessness.
