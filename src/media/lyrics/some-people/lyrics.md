Want me to want you

And some people want you

Some people want to just love you and <span id="hazardous">*own* you</span>

<br/>

<span id="freedom">Free, freedom's a lie, freedom's a lie if you're my honey</span>

*(In my heart / in this life / <span id="hell-is-other-people-1">hell is other people</span>, yeah / in my heart and some people give me heart attacks)*

Here's how I will die, just like I live, alone with nobody

*(In my heart / in this life / hell is other people, yeah / in my heart and some people give me heart attacks)*

<br/>

Want me to want you

And some people want you

Some people want to just <i>have</i> you and <i>own</i> you

<br/>

Want me to want you

And some people want you

Some <span id="hell-is-other-people-2">people want to pass judgment yet hold you</span>

<br/>

Free, freedom's a lie, freedom's a lie if you're my honey

*(In my heart / in this life / hell is other people, yeah / in my heart and some people give me heart attacks)*

Here's how I will die, just like I live, alone with nobody

*(In my heart / in this life / hell is other people, yeah / in my heart and some people give me heart attacks)*
