Imagine a beautiful building.

As you walk through its doors you see a reception desk.

The receptionist is not there, but by the desk is a box of chocolate.

You look around, reach out and take one.

A person you hadn’t noticed right behind you says “Wow! I’ve always wanted to try that chocolate! How is it?” and grabs one too.

Now you have an accomplice. You chat about how good the chocolate is.

Mmmm. What a good day this is turning out to be.

But, wait.

What if the person you hadn’t noticed behind you instead says “How could you? How could you take something that doesn’t belong to you? I can’t believe you just grabbed that!”

Now you feel uncomfortable.

The receptionist returns to the desk. She glares at you.“That was not yours.”

You stand there feeling awful.

When Sartre said “hell is other people” he noted that we cannot really know ourselves without taking into consideration how we are regarded by others.

If we are judged by another, it becomes a part of our own opinion of ourselves.

Others are so important to us, we cannot complete the puzzle of who we are without them.

This is why he concludes "hell is other people".
