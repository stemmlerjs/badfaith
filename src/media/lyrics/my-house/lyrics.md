My house / I'd like take you to my house

My house / I'd like take you to my house

<br/>

Out by the lake, where fishes tend to procreate

Can't hardly wait, it seems that this life has a way to

Pull you away, from how you want to live today

Pull you away, from what you want but do delay

<br/>

My house / I'd like take you to my house

My house / I'd like take you to my house

<br/>

A silent scream, while city life asphyxiates

And in old age, with all your stock in real estate

You'll move a way, 'cos city life just has a way

To suffocate, and 'cos city life just complicates

<br/>

My house / I'd like take you to my house

My house / I'd like take you to my house
