title: Trade Your Soul
---

Dumber, smarter, labor, labor, labor, dumber, sadder, cadaver

Dumber, smarter, labor, labor, labor, dumber, sadder, cadaver

<span id="chant">Dumber, smarter, labor, labor, labor, dumber, sadder, cadaver</span>

Dumber, smarter, labor, labor, labor, dumber, sadder, cadaver

<br/>

I want to be alive

And yet I compromise

I'm longing for the time

When I can rest my eyes

Your parents trade it all away

So that you can too 

Working everyday

And that's the trade

<br/>

If you wanna live

Then you gotta get paid

You gotta rip a part of your soul

And that's the trade

<br/>

Dumber, smarter, labor, labor, labor, dumber, sadder, cadaver

Dumber, smarter, labor, labor, labor, dumber, sadder, cadaver

Dumber, smarter, labor, labor, labor, dumber, sadder, cadaver

Dumber, smarter, labor, labor, labor, dumber, sadder, cadaver
